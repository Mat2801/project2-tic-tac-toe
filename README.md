# Tic Tac Toe

![Tic Tac Toe](documents/images//tictaktoe-logo.png)

I have decided for my second project to develop a small game we all know called Tic Tac Toe, the reason for the is because it shows off
what I have learnt so far with javascript and its a one of the more complex games to develop. I used to love this game and feel like 
it still hasn't got old. THe idea is to make this a multiplayer game which can eiter end in a win or a draw. Im hoping to design this
to look a little different than the old version of the game to give it a more up to date look.

Here you can find a demo of the deployed website [here](https://mat2801.github.io/project2-tic-tac-toe/)

## UX

#### 1.1. Project Goals
My goals for this project are to show what i have learnt so far in javascript along with adding some nice styling
i decided to make a Tic Tak Toe game. The reason i choose thise game is because i always used to enjoy playing this 
game, many people know this game already and its always a good laugh. The primary focus of this project, is to allow full 
functional interaction with it's users to allow for a quick and easy user experience. 
My main goal was to create a interactive easy to use game. I choose to use a simple layout using an attractive landing page image, 
to catch users attention. I opted for a colour scheme of black, green and blue, the reason for this is the darker colour suits
the games look like old fashioned style along with the blue and green to compliment the logo.
