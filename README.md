# Tic Tac Toe

![Tic Tac Toe](documents/images//tictactoe-logo.png)

I have decided for my second project to develop a small game we all know called Tic Tac Toe, the reason for the is because it shows off
what I have learnt so far with javascript and its a one of the more complex games to develop. The reason i choose this game is because i always used to enjoy playing tic tac toe, many people know this game already and its always a good laugh. The primary focus of this project, is to allow full 
functional interaction with it's users to allow for a quick and easy user experience. 
My main goal was to create a interactive easy to use game. I choose to use a simple layout using an attractive landing page image
to catch users attention.

Here you can find a demo of the deployed website [here](https://mat2801.github.io/project2-tic-tac-toe/)

## UX

#### 1.1. Design

##### Colour Scheme
I opted for a colour scheme of black, green and blue, the reason for this is the darker colour suits
the games look like old fashioned style along with the blue and green to compliment the logo.

##### Typography
I decided to go with a retro to modern handwriting style of text. I feel the retro really suits the game 
along with the handwriting style font. The font i decided to use is Pacifico.

##### Layout
I wanted to create an uncluttered game screen where navigation was easy to understand. So i opted for an old 
school looking main menu that lead only to 2 destinations. When on the game board you can see the simplicity along
with the colours to make the game board stand out. When heading to the rules section i tried to keep with the retro 
look to keep with the theme of the game.

##### Sound
I decided to add sound to buttons to continue the retro theme and add a little extra for the user, along with a sound for a win or a draw.

#### 1.2. Wireframes

All ```Wireframes``` were designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) Follow the links below
